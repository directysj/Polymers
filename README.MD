# codes
A C++ code for the coarse-grained sticker spacer beads bonded harmonically as linear polymer chains. 
The coarse-graining is performed at the residue level where each bead represents 
an amino acid of a given diameter. 
The system units are used as Lennard-Jones, given in "Computer Simulation of Liquids" by M. P. Allen and D. J. Tildesley, Oxford University Press (1987).
